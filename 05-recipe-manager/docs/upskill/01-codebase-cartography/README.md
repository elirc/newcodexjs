# Codebase Cartography

Project: **Recipe Manager** (`05-recipe-manager`)

- Map the system before changing it.
- Start with reading order, then trace key flows.
- Use domain glossary during interviews and code review.
## Verification Notes

- Generated from inspected files in `05-recipe-manager`.
- Important anchors inspected: `client/src/App.tsx`, `server/src/app.ts`, `server/src/routes/recipeRoutes.ts`, `server/src/services/recipeService.ts`, `server/src/models/recipeModel.ts`, `server/db/migrations/001_initial_schema.ts`.
- Commands were inferred from `client/package.json` and `server/package.json`; run them locally after installing dependencies and creating the database.
- Uncertainty: these docs are a training layer, not a guarantee that every route has complete test coverage.
